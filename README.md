### Hello, Iâ€™m Eric

I'm a software engineer with diverse experience, currently focusing on cloud-oriented development with Java, Spring, and AWS. 

I completed the 
[AWS Certified Developer - Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/017f3a78-2c86-45ea-b753-779167e80393) certification in March of 2022, the 
[AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/bae423ab-5d57-4c58-b0f6-812f91c59964) certification in December of 2021, 
and the [Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Developer](https://www.credly.com/badges/e8120e4b-8f1f-4437-9f2b-5e7a00c38af9) certification in June of 2020.

Since 2018, while completing my [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/4EVRWQDC), my day job has primarily involved Android development with Java along with back-end REST Web API development. Iâ€™ve been in a variety of software development roles over the last 20 years. I was a successful I.T. Project Manager for six years, with an emphasis on software development and system implementation projects. Iâ€™ve also done a lot of web application development, primarily ASP.NET with C# and SQL Server.
